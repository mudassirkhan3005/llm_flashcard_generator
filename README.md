# llm_flashcard_generator
This project is a Flashcard Generation Tool powered by LLMs like Google's flan-t5 or OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo. It is designed to help students, educators, and lifelong learners convert raw educational content — such as textbook excerpts, PDFs, or lecture notes — into concise, accurate, and structured flashcards to support efficient revision.
